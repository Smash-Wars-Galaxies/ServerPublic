## What is SWGEmu?

Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) was an immensely popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) introduced by Sony Online Entertainment in 2003. Despite its eventual shutdown in 2011, SWG left a lasting legacy in the hearts of thousands of players.

The SWGEmu project aims to recapture the magic of the game by focusing on a specific milestone: Pre-CU, or Pre-Combat Upgrade. The Combat Upgrade introduced significant changes to the gameplay, which were met with disapproval by many devoted players. It was in response to these changes that the SWGEmu project was bornâ€”a collective effort to "recreate" the game as it existed during the Pre-CU era.

At the core of the SWGEmu project lies the "Emulator," referring to the meticulously crafted server software being developed by the SWGEmu team. This Emulator endeavors to faithfully mimic Sony Online Entertainment's server-side software, which once hosted the immersive galaxies of Star Wars Galaxies during the Pre-CU era. To achieve this ambitious goal, the SWGEmu team has dedicated countless hours to reverse-engineering the code from scratch. They have built their own custom engine and core game logic, ensuring that every detail is crafted with love and precision.

The SWGEmu project is not only a nostalgic journey for passionate players but also a testament to the dedication and perseverance of a talented team. By resurrecting the Pre-CU era, SWGEmu offers an opportunity for both veterans and newcomers to experience the rich and captivating universe of Star Wars Galaxies, as it was once cherished by thousands of fans.
